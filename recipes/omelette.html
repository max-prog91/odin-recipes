   <h2>Preparing steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the Eggs:</h3>
            <p>In a medium bowl, crack the eggs and add the milk (or water). Season with salt and black pepper. Whisk until the mixture is well combined and slightly frothy.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Heat the Pan:</h3>
            <p>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and let it melt, swirling it around to coat the bottom of the pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cock the Eggs:</h3>
            <p>Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Let it cook undisturbed for about 1-2 minutes, or until the edges start to set.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Stir and Fold:</h3>
            <p>Using a spatula, gently stir the eggs, pushing the cooked edges toward the center while tilting the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges. Continue this process until the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Add Fillings:</h3>
            <p>If using fillings, sprinkle them evenly over one half of the omelette.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
