    <h2>How to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Sauté the Vegetables:
            </h3>
            <p>In a large pot, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for about 5 minutes, or until softened and translucent.
                Add the minced garlic and sliced mushrooms. Cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are browned and have released their moisture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Add Broth and Seasoning:
            </h3>
            <p>Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth and add the dried thyme. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 15 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Blend the Soup:</h3>
            <p>sing an immersion blender, carefully blend the soup until smooth. If you prefer a chunkier texture, you can blend only half of the soup and leave the rest as is. Alternatively, you can transfer the soup in batches to a countertop blender.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Stir in Cream:
            </h3>
            <p>Return the blended soup to the pot (if using a countertop blender) and stir in the heavy cream. Heat the soup over low heat until warmed through. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Serve:
            </h3>
            <p>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley if desired. Serve warm with crusty bread or a side salad.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
