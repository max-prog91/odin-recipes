    <h2>How to make a pie</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the Pie Crust</h3>
            <p>In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and sugar.
                Add cold butter and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
                Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough comes together.
                Divide the dough in half, shape into discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Make the Apple Filling:</h3>
            <p>Peel, core, and slice the apples.
                In a large bowl, combine sliced apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Toss to coat evenly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Assemble the Pie:</h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
                Roll out one disc of dough on a floured surface to fit your pie pan. Place it in the pan.
                Fill the crust with the apple mixture and dot with butter.
                Roll out the second disc of dough and place it over the filling. Seal and flute the edges. Cut slits in the top crust for steam to escape.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Bake the Pie:</h3>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
                Reduce the temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue baking for 35-45 minutes, or until the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown.</p>
