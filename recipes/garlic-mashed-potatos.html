    <h2>How to make steps.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h1>Prepare the Potatoes:</h1>
            <p>Peel the potatoes and cut them into evenly sized chunks (about 1-2 inches). Place the potato chunks and garlic cloves in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add a pinch of salt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>Cook the Potatoes:</h1>
            <p>Bring the pot to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>Drain and Steam:</h1>
            <p>Drain the potatoes and garlic in a colander. Allow them to sit for a few minutes to let the steam escape, which helps to keep the potatoes fluffy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>Mash the Potatoes:</h1>
            <p>Return the drained potatoes and garlic to the pot. Use a potato masher or a ricer to mash the potatoes until smooth and creamy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>Add Butter and Cream:</h1>
            <p>Stir in the room temperature butter and heavy cream (or milk) until fully incorporated. Adjust the consistency by adding more cream if desired.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>Season:</h1>
            <p>Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Mix well to combine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>Serve:</h1>
            <p>Transfer the garlic mashed potatoes to a serving bowl. Garnish with chopped fresh chives or parsley if desired. Serve warm.</p>
        </li>
